# Ork Pre-release file
Hello Gits!

I've thrown together a Battlescribe file using what's been leaked of the upcoming Codex so far.
This includes ork changes, buggies, new wagons, relics, traits and even the powers of da WAAAAGH!

## Usage
To use:
  1. Download Orks-Prerelease.catz
  2. Place into Battlescribe `Warhammer 40,000k Edition folder` (You should see other .catz files there too)
     
     Windows: Found at: `./Users/Eonfuzz/BattleScribe/data/Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition/`
     
     Android: Use a file manager to move the file to `./sdcard/android/data/net.battlescribe.mobile.rostereditor/files/data/Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition/`
     
     iOS: TODO
  3. Create a new army using Ork-Prerelease
