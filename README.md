# Ork Pre-release file
Hello Gits!

I've thrown together a Battlescribe file using what's been leaked of the upcoming Codex so far.
This includes Points, Relics, Warlord traits and rules.

## Usage
To use:
  1. Download Orks-Prerelease.catz
  2. Place into Battlescribe `Warhammer 40,000k Edition folder` (You should see other .catz files there too)
     
     Windows: Found at: `./Users/Eonfuzz/BattleScribe/data/Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition/`
     
     Android: Use a file manager to move the file to `./sdcard/android/data/net.battlescribe.mobile.rostereditor/files/data/Warhammer 40,000 8th Edition/`
     
     iOS: TODO
  3. Create a new army using Ork-Prerelease
  
## Known Issues
These will be fixed when I get a bit more time. It's late right now =(
### No new buggies (This will come soon!)
### Not all Warlord Relics are in
